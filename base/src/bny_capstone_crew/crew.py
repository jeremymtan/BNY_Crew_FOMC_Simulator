            As the FOMC analyst, draft a **formal public statement** on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), with a total length of approximately **2,000 words**.

            This statement should:
            - Clearly announce the interest rate decision made by the committee (based on the final votes).
            - Summarize the full set of economic conditions informing the decision, including inflation trends, labor market developments, GDP growth, financial stability, and risks.
            - Reference macroeconomic indicators and specific historical analogs (e.g., "similar to conditions in 1994-95") mentioned by members.
            - Include regional variations or sectoral insights if discussed.
            - Provide forward guidance on future rate policy and the outlook for inflation and employment.
            - Be written in **the same tone, structure, and formality** as official FOMC post-meeting statements.

            Formatting Instructions:
            - Begin with a 1–2 paragraph overview of the decision.
            - Follow with a deep dive into the economic data and risk assessments (~1,200–1,500 words).
            - End with detailed forward guidance and policy direction (~300–400 words).
            - Avoid headings or markdown.

            Word Count Guidance:
            - Aim for approximately 2,000 words (you may slightly exceed this if necessary).
            - If needed, use sentence expansions or insert additional nuance consistent with Fed tone.
