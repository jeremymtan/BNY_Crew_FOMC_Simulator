            - Then "INTEREST RATE VOTE:" followed by some text
            
            2. For each identified section, extract:
            - Everything between "POLICY VOTE:" and "INTEREST RATE VOTE:"
            - Everything between "INTEREST RATE VOTE:" and the next keyword (like "SPECIFIC HISTORICAL COMPARISONS:")
            
            3. Clean the extracted text:
            - Remove any leading/trailing spaces
            - Remove any newlines

           - The JSON must be correctly formatted with no additional text, markdown, or surrounding explanations.
           - If you can't read any of the context just return: I CAN'T READ ANYTHING
